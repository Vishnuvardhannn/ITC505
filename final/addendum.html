        <p>
            The primary goal of this project was to create an interactive and visually appealing "Lights Out" game that adhered to the given requirements while introducing additional features like a <strong>target moves counter</strong>, <strong>actual move counter</strong>, <strong>timer</strong>, and a <strong>restart button</strong>. Here's how the process unfolded:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Design and Structure:</strong><br>
            The HTML layout was kept minimal and organized. Additional elements, such as the statistics section (target moves, moves, and timer), were added for user interactivity. A <strong>restart button</strong> was introduced for convenience, allowing users to restart the game at any point without refreshing the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Styling Choices:</strong><br>
            A gradient background and vibrant colors (blue for active cells and pink for inactive cells) were chosen to create a visually modern and engaging design. Subtle hover effects and smooth transitions were implemented to enhance the user experience and make interactions intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Game Logic:</strong><br>
            The game board is dynamically created with a 5x5 grid. A solveable random starting configuration was ensured by simulating random clicks rather than assigning states randomly. This guarantees every board is playable. The toggling logic, including neighbors, was carefully implemented and tested to ensure no edge cases caused errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Additional Features:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Target Moves: Displayed to challenge users to complete the puzzle efficiently.</li>
                <li>Move Counter: Updates dynamically each time the user clicks on a cell.</li>
                <li>Timer: Starts when the game loads, updating every second, and stops when the user wins.</li>
                <li>Restart Button: Fully resets the board, moves, and timer for a fresh start.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Challenges and Solutions:</strong><br>
            One challenge was ensuring the board was always solveable without manually testing configurations. This was addressed by simulating random clicks, which inherently maintain solveability. Additionally, implementing a proper restart function required careful resetting of all variables and states to avoid leftover data from the previous game.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Insights Gained:</strong><br>
            This project reinforced the importance of modular design and the use of DOM manipulation for dynamic content creation. It also highlighted the significance of user-centric design in making a game enjoyable and accessible. This project not only met all stated requirements but also added several quality-of-life improvements, resulting in a polished and engaging game experience.
