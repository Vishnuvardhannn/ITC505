    <h1>Scene III. A road near the Shepherd's cottage.</h1>
    <p>Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing</p>
    <p><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></p>
    <p>When daffodils begin to peer,<br>
    With heigh! the doxy over the dale,<br>
    Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;<br>
    For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.</p>

    <p>The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,<br>
    With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!<br>
    Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;<br>
    For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.<br>
    The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,<br>
    With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,<br>
    Are summer songs for me and my aunts,<br>
    While we lie tumbling in the hay.<br>
    I have served Prince Florizel and in my time<br>
    wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:<br>
    But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?<br>
    The pale moon shines by night:<br>
    And when I wander here and there,<br>
    I then do most go right.<br>
    If tinkers may have leave to live,<br>
    And bear the sow-skin budget,<br>
    Then my account I well may, give,<br>
    And in the stocks avouch it.<br>
    My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to<br>
    lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who<br>
    being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise<br>
    a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and<br>
    drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is<br>
    the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful<br>
    on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to<br>
    me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought<br>
    of it. A prize! a prize!</p>

    <p>Enter Clown</p>

    <p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
    <p>Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod<br>
    yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred<br>
    shorn. what comes the wool to?</p>

    <p><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></p>
    <p>[Aside]<br>
    If the springe hold, the cock's mine.</p>

    <p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
    <p>I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am<br>
    I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound<br>
    of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will<br>
    this sister of mine do with rice? But my father<br>
    hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it<br>
    on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for<br>
    the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good<br>
    ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but<br>
    one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to<br>
    horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden<br>
    pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;<br>
    nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I<br>
    may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of<br>
    raisins o' the sun.</p>

    <p><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></p>
    <p>O that ever I was born!<br>
    Grovelling on the ground</p>

    <p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
    <p>I' the name of me--</p>

    <p><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></p>
    <p>O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and<br>
    then, death, death!</p>

    <p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
    <p>Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay<br>
    on thee, rather than have these off.</p>

    <p><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></p>
    <p>O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more<br>
    than the stripes I have received, which are mighty<br>
    ones and millions.</p>

    <p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
    <p>Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a<br>
    great matter.</p>

    <p><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></p>
    <p>I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel<br>
    ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon<br>
    me.</p>

    <p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
    <p>What, by a horseman, or a footman?</p>

    <p><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></p>
    <p>A footman, sweet sir, a footman.</p>

    <p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
    <p>Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he<br>
    has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,<br>
    it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,<br>
    I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.</p>

    <p><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></p>
    <p>O, good sir, tenderly, O!</p>

    <p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
    <p>Alas, poor soul!</p>

    <p><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></p>
    <p>O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my<br>
    shoulder-blade is out.</p>

    <p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
    <p>How now! canst stand?</p>

    <p><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></p>
    <p>[Picking his pocket]<br>
    Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done me<br>
    a charitable office.</p>

    <p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
    <p>Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.</p>

    <p><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></p>
    <p>No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have<br>
    a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,<br>
    unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or<br>
    any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;<br>
    that kills my heart.</p>

    <p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
    <p>What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?</p>

    <p><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></p>
    <p>A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with<br>
    troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the<br>
    prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his<br>
    virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of<br>
    the court.</p>

    <p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
    <p>His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped<br>
    out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay<br>
    there; and yet it will no more but abide.</p>
